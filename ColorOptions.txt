Personally, I am a fan of the old powershell "blue" color code.  This is
is not the norm for newer versions.  So I have enabled this in the 
beginning of the command file.  You can disable this if you wish by 
commenting the lines out of the command file.

Technically, the older color codes are non standard RGB color codes:
Background: 1,36,86
Foreground: 238,237,240
